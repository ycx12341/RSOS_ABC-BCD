MATLAB CODE
============

This folder includes MATLAB code of:

* Calculating the Bhattacharyya distances of different sets of parameters to the reference ones.

* Calculating the Bhattacharyya distance of one single vector of parameters to the reference ones.

* Standard optimizer using Bhattacharya distance as the discrepancy measuring metric. 

* Plots of different parameters' probability densities at the end of different rounds.
