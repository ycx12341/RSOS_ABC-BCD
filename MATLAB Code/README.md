MATLAB Code
============

This folder includes MATLAB code of:

* Calculating the Bhattacharyya distances of different sets of parameters to the reference ones. (**Bhattacharyya_distance.m**)

* Calculating the Bhattacharyya distance of one single vector of parameters to the reference ones. (**Bhattacharyya_distance_single_vec.m**)

* Standard optimizer using Bhattacharya distance as the discrepancy measuring metric. (**Optim.m**) 

* Plots of different parameters' probability densities at the end of different rounds. (**Plots.m**)
