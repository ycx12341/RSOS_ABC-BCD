All the synthetic data (Bhattacharya distance results and parameter values in different rounds) are presented here. The MATLAB and R
code used in the extra attempts were not uploaded, as they were very similar to the ones used in the 1st attempt, which were uploaded to 
the "MATLAB code" and "R code" folders.
